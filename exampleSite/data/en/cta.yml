  content: "Cincinnati comes from the ancient Roman hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus,
    which was a Roman Republic hero in the 5th century B.C. It is said that the Roman
    Senate asked him to fight in the army of the republic against the Aequi (people
    from Italy who occupied parts of the Avens River, known today as Velino). Cincinnatus
    agreed and left his small farm to led the army against the foreign invaders, defeating
    them in just a few days’ time. The Roman Senate was greatly appreciative and wanted
    to award him with dictatorial powers, but he refused and went back to his farm.
    \nAt the beginning of the American Revolution War in 1775, the 13 colonies did
    not have an army. The Continental Army, an official organized military and The
    Framers, gave the charitable association the name The Society of the Cincinnati,
    electing George Washington to precede as the first chief and commander in 1783.
    \nThey decided upon this name because they believed that the qualities and characteristics
    of Cincinnatus (humility, unselfishness, sacrifice and commitment to the public
    welfare): an act of altruism, were essential to sustain a republic. \nIn 1790,
    Arthur St. Clair, president of the State Society of the Cincinnati of Pennsylvania
    and governor of the Northwest Territory founded in 1787 (Ohio 1803; Indiana 1816;
    Illinois 1818; Michigan 1837; Wisconsin 1848; Minnesota 1858), named the town
    after the Society as an act of appreciation and because many members from the
    Society settled in the Northwest Territory Region. \n\nCincinnati is where the
    north begins in the US and played a very important role during slavery, which
    dates back far as 1619 up until the end of the Civil War, when President Abraham
    Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared
    \"that all persons held as slaves\" within the rebellious states \"are, and henceforward
    shall be free.\" Before then, slaves had to escape from the torture and horrors
    of enslavement and did it with the help of abolitionists by using the Underground
    Railroad. \nThe Underground Railroad was a secret network made up of different
    routes, houses, hidden places, symbols and songs starting in the south where slavery
    heavily persisted and leading to Canada which was considered the land of the free.
    \nCincinnati was one of a headquarters for this secret network because it was
    near Cleveland, which was the last stop before they crossed Lake Erie making it
    to “The Promised Land”.  The slaves used to sing the spiritual folklore The Promised
    Land which carried double meaning-The slaveholders thought they were referring
    to going to heaven after death, but for the slaves and members of the secret network,
    it also meant Canada.\nThe name Cincinnatus also seemed to fit quite well as he
    was dedicated to agricultural, so was Cincinnati. It had many crops, soybean being
    its leading, followed by corn, wheat, hay, oats, popcorn and many livestock.  "
