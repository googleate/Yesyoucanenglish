  title: '"Me and the city"'
  content: "Cincinnati comes from the ancient Roman hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus,
    which was a Roman Republic hero in the 5th century B.C. It is said that the Roman
    Senate asked him to fight in the army of the republic against the Aequi (people
    from Italy who occupied parts of the Avens River, known today as Velino). Cincinnatus
    agreed and left his small farm to led the army against the foreign invaders, defeating
    them in just a few days’ time. The Roman Senate was greatly appreciative and wanted
    to award him with dictatorial powers, but he refused and went back to his farm.
    \nAt the beginning of the American Revolution War in 1775, the 13 colonies did
    not have an army. The Continental Army, an official organized military and The
    Framers, gave the charitable association the name The Society of the Cincinnati,
    electing George Washington to precede as the first chief and commander in 1783.
    \nThey decided upon this name because they believed that the qualities and characteristics
    of Cincinnatus (humility, unselfishness, sacrifice and commitment to the public
    welfare): an act of altruism, were essential to sustain a republic. \nIn 1790,
    Arthur St. Clair, president of the State Society of the Cincinnati of Pennsylvania
    and governor of the Northwest Territory founded in 1787 (Ohio 1803; Indiana 1816;
    Illinois 1818; Michigan 1837; Wisconsin 1848; Minnesota 1858), named the town
    after the Society as an act of appreciation and because many members from the
    Society settled in the Northwest Territory Region. \n\nCincinnati is where the
    north begins in the US and played a very important role during slavery, which
    dates back far as 1619 up until the end of the Civil War, when President Abraham
    Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared
    \"that all persons held as slaves\" within the rebellious states \"are, and henceforward
    shall be free.\" Before then, slaves had to escape from the torture and horrors
    of enslavement and did it with the help of abolitionists by using the Underground
    Railroad. \nThe Underground Railroad was a secret network made up of different
    routes, houses, hidden places, symbols and songs starting in the south where slavery
    heavily persisted and leading to Canada which was considered the land of the free.
    \nCincinnati was one of a headquarters for this secret network because it was
    near Cleveland, which was the last stop before they crossed Lake Erie making it
    to “The Promised Land”.  The slaves used to sing the spiritual folklore The Promised
    Land which carried double meaning-The slaveholders thought they were referring
    to going to heaven after death, but for the slaves and members of the secret network,
    it also meant Canada.\nThe name Cincinnatus also seemed to fit quite well as he
    was dedicated to agricultural, so was Cincinnati. It had many crops, soybean being
    its leading, followed by corn, wheat, hay, oats, popcorn and many livestock.  Proctor
    & Gamble, one of the most notorious worldwide Industries was founded in Cincinnati
    in 1837. They make many personal health and hygiene products that many people
    use daily such as Fairy, Ariel, Don Limpio, Dodot, H & S, Oral-B and Ambi Pur.
    Its international headquarters is located in the center of the downtown area which
    has easy access to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nIn the
    center of the downtown area, you will find Fountain Square and The Tyler Davidson
    Fountain placed in the middle. The Square has been the symbolic center for the
    city since 1871 and many gather there for events that are held throughout the
    year. \nI was born in Athens, Georgia, which is in the deep south of the United
    States, but when I was six months old, after my mother had recovered from giving
    birth, we moved to Cincinnati where I grew up and had a private catholic education.
    From an early age, I knew I wanted to help people, but never thought or dreamt
    it would be through education.  \nAfter obtaining a bachelor’s degree in international
    relations, from the University of Cincinnati, I moved to Madrid, Spain not only
    to learn the language, but also to learn its customs and culture while reaping
    the many benefits a study and/or living abroad experience has to offer. Since
    then, I have managed to get a bachelor’s degree in psychology and two masters:
    one in psychology and another one in Teaching English as a Second Language in
    Secondary Education, from public Spanish universities. \nI still seriously consider
    going back to school to earn a doctorate degree. If not, I will be content with
    writing a book about my overall experience in Madrid, Spain as an African American."
