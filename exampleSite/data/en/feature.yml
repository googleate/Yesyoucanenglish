  content: Hi, my name is John. I am from Cincinnati, Ohio. Ohio is called the Buckeye
    State because there are a lot of buckeye trees and nuts. The original name is
    “Hetuck” which comes from the Native Americans and means deer eye. They called
    the nut this because it resembles a deer eye.
