    content: "“I do not have any expectations: What will happen will happen”.\nI have
      taught in private and private with public funding schools, but I have never
      had the opportunity to teach in a public institution in Spain. I’m looking forward
      to seeing how they work and operate.\nAs a Language Assistant, I will look for
      ways in which everyone will reap and grow personally and professionally from
      the experience, hoping that teachers and students take advantage of all my strengths,
      overlooking or not noticing my weaknesses. Thus, my duty as an auxiliary is
      to aid the teachers by producing what is asked of me and enhancing the students’
      English abilities whenever the chance arises. "
