Cervantes Institute is a co-education bilingual high school with a lot of educational history, situated in the center of Madrid, in a historical building. Its historical background is due, on one hand, to the fact that the institution has been functioning for almost a century, since it was created in 1931, the year of the beginning of the Second Republic in Spain, which makes it ninety years old.

On the other hand, because the school has changed addresses quite a few times in nine decades before ending up in its present location on Embajadores Street, in a building built in 1881. It was first a School for Veterinarians until 1960 when it became a High School and twenty years later, in 1981, when democracy arrived, it became a co-ed school.

When talking about the Cervantes Institute, it should certainly be remembered that very important Spanish intellectuals were teachers there. To name a few, let’s mention Antonio Machado, the writer, who taught French until he went into exile at the end of the Spanish Civil War, and also the artist Rafael de Penagos and the philosopher María Zambrano.

Today there are over a thousand students attending classes at Cervantes Institute. Many of them live in the neighboring areas, but there are also many boys and girls from all over Madrid. One must say that they are mostly well behaved, polite and respectful which makes the atmosphere at school nice. The students have a good level of English and seem interested in what is going on during class. These days, because of Covid, the average class of about twenty-three students has been reduced to about halve that size, so we teach smaller groups of ten, in most cases twelve.

[**Contributions to the LA Program**]()

Because of my interpersonal and communicative skills, along with my therapeutical background and knowledge, I mostly use communicative approach in teaching methods such as humanistic, which helps me relate better to the students and get them to relax, feel free, be themselves, open up and talk more. But every student is different and some might need other methods such as the audio-lingual which involves a lot of repetition to help them grasp and get a hold of the language.

[**Main activities developed as a LA**]()

Bilingual school are required for their students to achieve a particular level of English set by the guidelines of the Common European Framework of Reference for Language (CEFR) and Council of Europe. Students are evaluated by different test yearly to make sure that the standards are being met. The Cambridge Language Assessment is used at our Institute and has five levels (KET; PET; FCE; CAE; CPE) and the exam covers all four skills.

Due to my prior experience in preparing students for official English exams in private and private with government funding schools, I help prepare the students for the speaking part of the exam.
