[**Learning Vocabulary from Short Stories and Pictures**]()

My final project entitled “Learning Vocabulary from Short Stories and Pictures” was an Eureka moment. I had planned on doing a different topic, but at the last minute I decided that I had something better. The project deals with helping students acquire vocabulary of a second language from short stories and pictures. It is divided into two parts with different levels.

The first part is aimed at students who have A2 and B1 levels and the second part is geared toward levels B2 and up. Upper-level students will be able to read the complete story while lower-level students will not, due to the increase difficulty of vocabulary and grammar as the story evolves.

The story is fiction based on real life events and is illustrated with pictures, making it more interesting for the lecturer. It also leaves room for activities dealing with research and surveys that both teachers and students can make use of. This helps in development of having a working knowledge of vocabulary used for description, reporting graphs and surveys in a fun way.

[**The House of Slaves**](https://form.jotform.com/210162460449349)

The House of Slaves is a short story written in third person. It is fiction based on real life events and historical facts, which takes place in Senegal, filled with colorful images of the journey. Keith, an African American living in Madrid, Spain, is granted a scholarship from yesyoucanENGLISH school and Vicente is in charge of the investigation department. Keith is very excited about the trip and also is looking forward to getting to know his roots, where part of his ancestors came from, Africa. That year, Vicente was doing the first part of a longitudinal study, investigating what young children in Senegal wanted to be when they grew up. As the adventure unravels, starting from Daker, destine to Gorée Island, they talk about the food they ate, people they met, things they did and finally Keith’s impression of the House of Slaves. It starts off from an elementary level, but as the story develops, it becomes more complex.

## Reading and Vocabulary Excercise

At the end of each part of the short story, there is multiple choice exercise, with five options, but only one correct answer, to help assimilate and process the vocabulary learned. A glossary will not be provided because students should be active in their learning and the translation method is applied which gives the student the exact translation in their own language, so it is advisable for students to note down the new vocabulary that is learned as they read the story to help them successfully complete the task.
