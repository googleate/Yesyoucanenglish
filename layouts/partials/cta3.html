				<p>After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in international relations, from the University of Cincinnati, I moved to Madrid, Spain not only to learn the language, but also to learn its customs and culture while reaping the many benefits a study and/or living abroad experience has to offer. Since then, I have managed to get a bachelor’s degree in psychology and two masters: one in psychology and another one in Teaching English as a Second Language in Secondary Education, from public Spanish universities.</p>
