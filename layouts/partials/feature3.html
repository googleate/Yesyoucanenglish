					<h2>Proctor & Gamble</h2>
					<p>Cincinnati comes from the ancient Roman hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, which was a Roman Republic hero in the 5th century B.C. It is said that the Roman Senate asked him to fight in the army of the republic against the Aequi (people from Italy who occupied parts of the Avens River, known today as Velino). Cincinnatus agreed and left his small farm to led the army against the foreign invaders, defeating them in just a few daysâ€™ time. The Roman Senate was greatly appreciative and wanted to award him with dictatorial powers, but he refused and went back to his farm. At the beginning of the American Revolution War in 1775, the 13 colonies did not have an army. The Continental Army, an official organized military and The Framers, gave the charitable association the name The Society of the Cincinnati, electing George Washington to precede as the first chief and commander in 1783. They decided upon this name because they believed that the qualities and characteristics of Cincinnatus (humility, unselfishness, sacrifice and commitment to the public welfare): an act of altruism, were essential to sustain a republic. In 1790, Arthur St. Clair, president of the State Society of the Cincinnati of Pennsylvania and governor of the Northwest Territory founded in 1787 (Ohio 1803; Indiana 1816; Illinois 1818; Michigan 1837; Wisconsin 1848; Minnesota 1858), named the town after the Society as an act of appreciation and because many members from the Society settled in the Northwest Territory Region.</p>
